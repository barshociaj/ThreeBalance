# ThreeBalance 

## This repository is archived and the application is no longer active

The Application retrieves UK's 3 operator PAYG balance (3-2-1) over an internet connection. Supports multiple numbers.

Please note that I am in no way affiliated with 3 network and built this application as a convenience feature to quickly login to see my 3 balance.

The application may stop working at any time if 3 changes the way they allow users to sign in to their services and retrieve usage information. If this happens and if I cannot restore the functionality, I will unpublish the application from Google Play and recommend you uninstall the application from your mobile phone or tablet.

I take no responsibility for your use of the application.

Built with ionic.
