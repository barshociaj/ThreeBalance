# ThreeBalance - Privacy Policy
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Three Balance (3 UK) for mobile devices. The Application retrieves UK's 3 operator PAYG balance (3-2-1) over any internet connection.

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
If you want to retrieve your 3 balance over a connection other than mobile data provided by 3, the Application asks for your ID and password needed to sign you in 3's web services. The Application then stores your Three (3 UK) login ID and password in local cache.

The Application retrieves your usage and allowance data from Three (3 UK) and also stores these in local cache.

In addition the Application accesses the log of your phone calls and messages using built-in Android application interfaces. This information is used to display the log along with estimated prices to you in the experimental mode.

## Third parties
The Application emulates browser connection between you and 3 (Three UK) servers. No information is exchanged with any other parties. Please note I am not affiliated with 3 in any way and have no control over how 3 uses your information.

## Security
The ID and password to 3 servers are stored in your local browser cache and transmitted securely over encrypted HTTPS protocol between the application and the 3 servers each time the application refreshes your balance information.

## Your Consent
By using the Application, you are accepting your own responsibility for any data you enter and view in the application. I take no responsibility for your use of the application.

## Contact
If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact me via email at fromapps@asteri.sk

## Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. You can check the history of this policy in github.
